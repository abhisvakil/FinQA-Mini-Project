It's essential to analyze the context and identify the relevant information needed to solve the problem. In this case, the problem asks about the five-year total return of the 2019 peer group compared to the 2018 peer group. To solve this problem, we need to compare the total return of the 2019 peer group with the 2018 peer group.\n\nThe total return of the 2019 peer group is 281.09, and the total return of the 2018 peer group is 286.22. Since 286.22 is greater than 281.09, the correct answer is \"No\". Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n'Program: greater(281.09, 286.22)'\nFinal Answer: No\n\nThis format ensures that your output adheres to the strict guidelines provided. Remember to generate the program code first and then calculate the final answer based on the generated code. In this case, the program code is simply \"greater(281.09, 286.22)\" since we're comparing the two total returns. Finally, the output is"
