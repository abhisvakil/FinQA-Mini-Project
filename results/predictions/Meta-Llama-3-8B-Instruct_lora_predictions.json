However, this program does not provide the actual values of these amounts. To calculate the amounts, you would need to subtract the unrecognized tax benefits from the total fin 48 gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Then, subtract goodwill from the total fin 48 gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Finally, divide the difference by the total fin 48 gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The actual values are not provided in the text. 2018\n\n* 2018: the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would decrease the effective tax rate is $ 139549.\n* 2018: the amount that would decrease goodwill is $ 0. 2018\n\n* 2018: the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would decrease the effective tax rate is $ 139549.\n* 2018: the amount that would decrease goodwill is $ 0. 2018\n\n* "

Yes, the question is asking about the percentage of the total capital spending from continuing operations by each of the business segments for printing papers.\n\nAccording to the table, the capital spending from continuing operations for printing papers was $ 592 million in 2005. The total capital spending from continuing operations was $ 973 million.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, divide the capital spending for printing papers by the total capital spending, and then multiply by 100:\n\n$592 million (printing papers) ÷ $973 million (total) = 0.60631\n0.60631 * 100 = 60.63%\n\nSo, approximately 60.63% ( 60.63 % ) of the total capital spending from continuing operations in 2005 was for printing papers."
