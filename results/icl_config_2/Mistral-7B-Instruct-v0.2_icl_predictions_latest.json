Since the problem asks for impairment costs recorded from 2003 to 2005 in millions, the calculated result needs to be multiplied by the given impairment charge amounts for each year ($ 0.6M, $ 0.6M, $ 4.7M). However, since the provided information does not include the exact number of rows in the table that correspond to the impaired assets, it's impossible to accurately calculate the total impairment costs without more context.
