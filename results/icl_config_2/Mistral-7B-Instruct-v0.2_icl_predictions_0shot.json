To find this percentage, we need to calculate the total amount of long-term debt obligations due subsequent to December 31, 2016, then determine the portion that represents the borrowing under the term loan facility. We can extract the relevant information from the text and table provided.\n\nFrom the text, we learn about Alexion's obligations under the credit facilities, which include term loan facilities. The credit agreement requires compliance with financial covenants, and Alexion had to provide financial statements and a compliance certificate for the third quarter of 2016. They reported having $175 million in current liabilities related to their term loan facilities as of December 31, 2016.\n\nThe table provides more detailed information about the long-term debt obligations. It shows that Alexion had $136 and $133 in facility lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. However, since the text states that they had $175 million in current liabilities related to their term loan facilities as of December 31, 2016, we assume that the difference between the two figures ($42 million) represents the borrowing under the term loan facility.\n\nTherefore, the calculation would look something like this:\n\nProgram:\nanswer := divide(sum([175]), sum([136+133])) * 100\nAnswer: ___________ %\n\nHowever, the problem statement requests the borrowing under the term loan facility as a percentage of the total contractual maturities of long-term debt obligations due subsequent to December 31, 2016. Since only the facility lease obligations are mentioned explicitly in the text, it seems reasonable to assume that they represent the long-term debt obligations referred to in the question. In this case, the borrowing under the term loan facility would be equal to the facility lease obligation shown in the table for the year 2016 ($175"

Since there are two components to this figure (amortized cost and fair value), each worth $368 million at the previous year, we can assume that the amortized cost was also $367 million on that date. Therefore, the fair value of corporate stocks alone is $510.52 billion ($510.52 million * $1,000).

Let me know if you have any other questions before diving into the problem at hand.\n\nThe goal is to find out the average price per share when 401362 warrants were exercised during 2008. The table provided lists various details about different batches of warrants, including their number of shares, exercise prices, and expiration dates. However, not all relevant information is given directly; instead, we are told that 252164 warrants had already expired by December 28th, 2008, leaving 18359850 unexercised warrants still available. We also learn that 401362 warrants were exercised during the same timeframe, leading to cash proceeds of $3.0 million for the company. Using this information, our task is to determine the average price per share paid during these exercises.\n\nTo accomplish this, first, let's identify the total number of exercisable warrants as of December 28th, 2008:\n\ntotalExercisableWarrrants = 18359850 - 252164\ntotalExercisableWarrrants = 18334686\n\nNext, we can figure out the total cash proceeds generated by dividing the total number of exercised warrants by the average price per share:\n\naverageSharePrice = totalCashProceeds / totalNumberOfSharesExercised\n\nWe know the total cash proceeds ($3.0M), but we do not have enough information to determine the exact number of shares exercised individually.

Calculate the difference between the expected life of employee stock options in 2014 and 2013.\n2. Multiply the result by -1 to make it negative. This will allow us to express the percentage change as a decimal rather than a positive number.\n3. Divide the result by the expected life of employee stock options in 2013. This will give us the ratio of the change in expected life to the original expected life.\n4. Subtract the result from 1 to obtain the percentage change.\n5. Finally, multiply the percentage change by 100 to convert it into a percentage.\n\nSo, the formula to calculate the percentage change would look something like this:\n\n= (Expected Life in 2013 - Expected Life in 2014) / Expected Life in 2013\n\nNow let's apply this formula using the given values:\n\nProgram:\nA: difference between 5.2 and 5.9\nB: multiply A by (-1)\nC: divide B by 5.2\nD: subtract C from 1\nE: multiply D by 100\nAnswer: E\n\nThe calculated percentage change should be approximately -11.54%."

So, the amount of credit lines can be found by calculating the difference between the total contractual obligations ($9,379 million) and the sum of short-term and intermediate-term obligations ($861 million + $1,517 million). This leaves us with $4,968 million in credit lines."

However, since the text provides us with the information about cash payments and adjustments that occurred between these dates, we can use this information to calculate the correct value instead of directly using the given figures. The total charges are $2,014 thousand, while the cash payments amounted to $-6,221 thousand. Adjustments totaled $-1,874 thousand. Since the accruals represent future expenses, they should be negative values. Therefore, we need to make sure all our calculations result in negative numbers. To do so, we will use parentheses when necessary. Our calculation would look like this: Subtract the sum of accrued balances at December 3, 1999, and cash payments from the sum of accrued balances at November 27, 1998, and total charges. This gives us the desired net change in the accrual balance.\n\nSo, the program would be: subtract(add(#0, #2), add(#0, subtract(#3, #1))). And the answer would be: $ -1,252 (or simply -$1,252 if you prefer writing it without parentheses)."

From the text, we know that American has issued AAG Series A Preferred Stock to satisfy these obligations. We also know that there were 107 million shares of AAG Series A Preferred Stock that had been converted into common stock as of February 19, 2014. Therefore, the original amount of these obligations was equal to the total amount of AAG Series A Preferred Stock issued. We can find this amount by looking at the table, which shows that the total bankruptcy settlement obligations were $5,424 million. To determine the portion related to single-dip equity obligations, we simply multiply the total obligations by the percentage of obligations represented by single-dip equity obligations, which is given as $1,246 million in the table. This gives us an answer of $1,125.2 million.\n\nProgram:\ntotal = #0\nsingle_dip_equity_portion = divide(#1, #3) * #0\nanswer = multiply(single_dip_equity_portion, #2)\n\nAnswer: 1125.2"

To find out the underlying operating profit for 2014, we can assume that these trends continue and calculate the increase based on the percentage change from 2012 to 2013. We do this by adding the difference between 2013 and 2012 underlying operating profits to the 2013 figure. The formula for calculating underlying operating profit in 2014 is: `underlying_operating_profit_2014 = add(#3, subtract(#1, divide(multiply(5767, 0.01), 1)))` where `#1` refers to the reported operating profit for 2011 ($1427 million) and `#3` refers to the reported operating profit for 2013 ($2098 million).

To find the average, first sum up the balances for each year and then divide by 2. In code, this can be done using the 'add' function to combine the values, followed by 'divide' to find the average. Note that since the table provides the figures in millions, we must ensure that all calculations are performed on million-dollar units. Therefore, we prefix the 'residential mortgage' label with '#2', indicating that it corresponds to the second row of the table (i.e., 2007), and prepend 'divide(#0,'total loans',0)'*2' to obtain the sum of residential mortgage balances across both years. Finally, we wrap the entire expression inside 'getitem(#0,'...)' to access the correct cell within the table."

    "raw_output": "subtract(#0, subtract(#0, add(add(#0, 187), add(#0, 95))))\nAnswer: 5617\n\nExplanation: To find out what 2015 net revenue would have been without any impact from retail electric price change and volume/weather, we first need to remove these impacts from the reported 2015 net revenue. We do this by subtracting the amounts attributed to these factors from the total 2015 net revenue. The given table shows us that the retail electric price change had an impact of 187 million dollars and the volume/weather had an impact of 95 million dollars. So our calculation should look something like this:\n\nprogram: subtract(total_net_revenue_in_millions, retail_electric_price_impact + volume_weather_impact)\nanswer: <desired_answer>\n\nIn our example above, the total net revenue in millions for 2015 was given as 5829, so we can substitute that value into our calculation:\n\nprogram: subtract(5829, 187 + 95)\nanswer: <desired_answer>\n\nNow let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nprogram: subtract(5829, 282)\nanswer: 5547\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the answer in millions, we must ensure that all intermediate calculations are done in millions as well. In our initial calculation, we used the given values directly from the text, which were already in millions. But when we added the retail electric price impact and the volume/weather impact, we forgot to convert them back to millions before adding them up. This resulted in incorrect intermediate calculations.\n\nTo correct this issue, we simply need to add 'M' suffix after each number affected by the retail electric price change and volume/weather:\n\nprogram: subtract(5829, add(187M, 95M))\nanswer: 5547M\n\nFinally, since the question asks for the answer without the 'M' suffix, we need to remove it once we have the final answer:\n\nanswer: 5547\n"

To find out the total return when investing $100,000 in Applied Materials Inc. and selling it in October 2011, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the annual returns for Applied Materials Inc. using the formula: ((Closing price at end of the year / Closing price at beginning of the year) – 1).\n2. Multiply the initial investment ($100,000) by the average annual return rate. This gives us the total return before considering dividends.\n3. Add up all the dividends received during the holding period.\n4. Finally, add the total return from Step 2 to the total dividends from Step 3.\n\nHere's the detailed calculation:\n\nStep 1: Find the annual returns for Applied Materials Inc.:\nAnnual Return = [(Ending Price / Beginning Price) ^ (Number of Years)]^(1/Number of Years) - 1\n\nYear 1: Annual Return = (116.07 / 100)^1 - 1 = 0.1567 or 15.67%\nYear 2: Annual Return = (118.21 / 113.08)^1 - 1 = 0.0313 or 3.13%\nYear 3: Annual Return"

We can find out how much money actually went towards new grants by calculating the total amount spent and then finding out how much was used for taxes. First, we find the total amount spent on share-based compensation: #0 = $18.1M. Then, we know that $6.3M was used for taxes, so we can determine how much money went into new grants by subtracting the tax amount from the total spending: subtract(#0, #1). However, since the text states that 63% of the total compensation cost goes toward taxes, we first need to figure out how much money was spent on new grants before taxes: multiply(#0, 0.4). Finally, we can find the after-tax share-based compensation cost by subtracting the tax amount from the pre-tax cost: subtract(multiply(#1, 0.4), #1). So the full calculation would look like this: add(#0, subtract(multiply(#1, 0.4), multiply(#1, 0.37))). This gives us an answer of approximately $13.52M."

The given table shows us that there was an increase of $6850 in mutual funds from 2009 to 2010. However, we also know that there were changes to the company's deferred compensation plan investments during this time. To account for these changes, we must first calculate the net change in total deferred compensation plan investments. We do this by finding the difference between the end-of-year totals ($8690 in 2010 and $7943 in 2009), and adding that result to the beginning balance of mutual funds ($6213). After obtaining the correct net figure, we can finally calculate the growth rate by dividing the net change by the number of quarters between 2009 and 2010 (which is 4)."

    "gold_answer": "658.13",
    "raw_output": "add(#0, multiply(#1, #2))\nAnswer: 14,141,411.2\n\nExplanation: The text states that there is $14.1M of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance awards, and these awards will be recognized as a charge to earnings over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. To find the total fair value of the non-vested performance awards at the beginning of the year, we can simply take the total unrecognized compensation cost ($14.1M) and divide it by the weighted-average period of recognition (1.6). However, since our calculator doesn't support division directly, we must instead multiply the total unrecognized compensation cost by the reciprocal of the weighted-average period of recognition (0.625), resulting in the total fair value of the non-vested performance awards at the beginning of the year.\n\nTherefore, the program would look like this: `add(#0, multiply(#1, 0.625))` where #0 represents the total unrecognized compensation cost ($14.1M) and #1 represents the reciprocal of the weighted-average period of recognition (0.625). The answer would then be $22,625,656.64, but since the problem asks for the result in thousands, we round down to $22,625,600."

    "raw_output": "add(subtract(#3, 57100), #5)\nAnswer: 106900\n\nExplanation: To find out how much space American Tower Corporation subleases in Woburn, first determine the total amount of space they own in Woburn (from the table). That's 57,800 sq ft. Then, subtract the amount of space they occupy themselves (57,100 sq ft), leaving 690 sq ft unaccounted for. However, since the problem asks for the 'portion', not the exact square footage, we must convert the percentage into decimal form before calculating the result. The proportion of the space subleased would be 690/163000 = 0.004219, so multiplying by 100% gives us 0.04219 or about 4.2%. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 4.2% * 57,800 = 106,900 sq ft. But since the problem asked for the number of square feet, we round up to 106,900 instead of 106,898. In summary, the program calculates the difference between the total owned space and the space occupied by AT&T, then converts the percentage given in the text to a decimal value and scales it up to obtain the final answer."

Let me know if you have any questions before we dive into the problem.\n\nThe goal is to find the growth rate in total assets between December 2012 and December 2013. The text provides us with the total assets values for each year, so our first step will be calculating the difference between the two years. We can then determine the growth rate by dividing the difference by the initial asset value and multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage. However, since the text asks for the 'growth rate', we should assume they mean the percentage change rather than an absolute growth amount. Therefore, we'll also include a check to ensure the result is positive before converting it to a percentage.\n\nIn summary, our solution would look something like this:\n\nProgram:\nAnswer: divide(subtract(#0total assets1), #0total assets1), *100\n\nThis code snippet does exactly what was described above. It finds the difference between the total assets in December 2013 and December 2012, and returns the percentage change."

    "gold_answer": "18.7",

We do this by finding the 'total' column at the end of each row in the provided table, then adjusting for the 'employee severance' and 'lease cancellation costs and other' columns. In 2004, these totals are $5,016k and $4,935k respectively; so, the net income for 2004 is $5,016k + $4,935k = $9,951k. Similarly, in 2005, the net income is $12,319k + $7,083k = $19,392k. The difference between these two values is our answer, calculated as follows: add(subtract(#0, 5400), subtract(#2, 13300)). Note that '#0' refers to the net income value for 2004 ($9,951k), and '#2' refers to the net income value for 2005 ($19,392k). By subtracting the employee severance costs for both years ($5.4m for 2004 and $13.3m for 2005), we obtain the adjusted net income figures for each year, which are then used to compute the difference."

We can do this using the 'subtract' operation with the beginning balances of the 'Interest and Penalties' column for the respective years as arguments. However, since the given table lists the 'Additions', 'Reductions', and 'Settlements' separately, we must first sum up all the relevant entries to obtain the correct starting points. Therefore, our program consists of adding the 'Additions' for each year and then calculating the difference between the resulting values.\n\nProgram:\ninterest_and_penalties_beginning_2015 = add(#1[2], #1[-1][2])\ninterest_and_penalties_beginning_2014 = add(#1[2], #1[-1][3])\ninterest_penalties_difference = subtract(interest_and_penalties_beginning_2015, interest_and_penalties_beginning_2014)\nAnswer: 7"

From the text, we learn that $57 million of these benefits would indeed affect the tax rate. So our solution involves calculating the difference between the initial and final amounts of unrecognized tax benefits ($70-$53=$17), then taking only the part of this difference that exceeds zero (since negative changes do not affect the tax rate).

We can see these values given in the table. To convert the values to millions, we simply divide each number by 1000000. So our calculations will be based on the following inputs: #0 = [$318063, $110457], #1 = [$60224, $77901]. Our first solution uses the 'sum' function to add up all the trading asset figures across rows, then subtracts the corresponding trading liability figure for each row using the 'negate' function before adding them together. This gives us the net trading assets figure for each year. We then divide this result by 1,000,000 to get the answer in millions. Alternatively, we could directly subtract the trading liabilities from the trading assets within each year without converting to arrays, but since the problem states that we should exclude derivatives when calculating net trading assets, we must ensure that only non-derivative trading assets and liabilities are included in our calculation. Therefore, we cannot simply subtract the entire 'trading liabilities' array from the 'trading assets' array because it includes derivative liabilities. Instead, we must filter out the relevant rows containing non-derivative items before performing the subtraction operation. However, since the provided text does mention that there are derivatives among the trading assets, it seems likely that they may also be excluded from the net trading assets calculation due to being offsetting positions. In such cases, it would still make sense to follow the same approach as above, i.e., including all trading assets and liabilities (both derivatives and non-derivatives) in the respective arrays, then filtering out the irrelevant rows when computing the net trading assets figure."

To find that out, first, we need to determine the current net asbestos reserves ($320). Then, we should find the net asbestos reserves before any adjustments ($320 - $47 = $273), and finally, calculate the difference between the initial net reserves and the adjusted ones ($320 - $273 = $47). However, since the text states that there was an unfavorable development of $121 on assumed reinsurance accounts, our answer must be incorrect. Therefore, let us double check the calculations. We notice that the text mentions that the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $290 in Q2 2011. This means that the correct value for the change in net asbestos reserves is actually $290 instead of $47. Thus, the correct answer would be the sum of the initial net asbestos reserves and the change in net asbestos reserves ($320 + $290 = $610). Since the given information only provides the net asbestos reserves before and after the adjustment, without explicitly stating their values, it seems there might be a mistake in the provided text. In such cases, it's essential to carefully read and understand the context to avoid errors while calculating."

We can use this information along with the provided context to determine the values needed for our calculations. The text states that net income decreased by $18.7 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Therefore, the difference in net income is $-18.7 million. Since we want to find the percentage of the decrease in net revenue, we will keep the net revenue figures as they are and only focus on calculating the percentage of the decrease in net income relative to net revenue.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\nProgram:\ndifference_in_net_income := subtract(#0, #1)\npercentage_of_decrease := divide(subtract(abs(#0), abs(#1)), abs(#0)) * 100\nprogram: difference_in_net_income, percentage_of_decrease\nanswer: difference_in_net_income\n\nThis program calculates the difference in net income (-$18.7 million) and then finds the percentage of that decrease relative to the net revenue in 2003 ($973.7 million).

The table shows that the total estimated purchase price was $6,156,900, and the cash portion of the consideration was $209,4800. We can find the estimated fair value of Hologic Common Stock by finding the difference between the total estimated purchase price and the cash portion of the consideration, then using that result to determine the number of shares issued. According to the text, one share of Hologic Common Stock was equal to $367,150. Therefore, we can set up our calculations as follows:\n\nProgram:\nanswer := subtract(#1, #2)\nProgram: multiply(#0, #5)\nAnswer: 3671500\n\nWe first calculate the difference between the total estimated purchase price ($6,156,900) and the cash portion of the consideration ($209,4800). This gives us the fair value of the securities issued, which is $3,832,900. Then, we multiply this amount by the value of one share of Hologic Common Stock ($367,150) to find the estimated fair value of all the shares issued.\n\nTherefore, the estimated fair value of Hologic Common Stock is $3,832,900 / $367,150 = 10,453.8 shares. However, since we only care about the whole number of shares, the answer would simply be 10,454 shares. But according to the instructions given, we should round down to the nearest whole number, so the final answer would be 10,453 shares."

Then, it calculates the total cost of these shares that were vested by May 31st of each year. Finally, it determines the average annual cost by dividing the total cost by the total number of unvested shares and then adjusting the result to account for the fact that only 2.5 years of the cost will eventually be recognized. The answer is rounded to the nearest whole number."

    "gold_answer": "0.81572",
    "raw_output": "subtract(#0, subtract(#0, add(#3, #4)))\nAnswer: 6892\n\nExplanation: To find out the amount of goodwill, first we need to determine the net assets acquired ($16,594). Then, we subtract the amounts of customer-related intangible assets ($4,091), contract-based intangible assets ($1,031), property and equipment ($267), and other current assets ($502). The difference between the net assets acquired and the sum of all other asset categories gives us the goodwill amount ($13,536). However, since the table shows negative values for current liabilities (-$2,347) and minority interest in equity of subsidiaries (-$486), we should adjust the net assets acquired by adding these amounts before calculating the goodwill. Therefore, the correct calculation would be: Net Assets Acquired = Total Assets Acquired + Current Liabilities + Minority Interest in Equity of Subsidiaries => $16,594 + ($2,347 + $486) => $19,427; Goodwill = Net Assets Acquired - Customer-Related Intangible Assets - Contract-Based Intangible Assets - Property and Equipment - Other Current Assets => $19,427 - $4,091 - $1,031 - $267 - $502 => $6,892. So, the goodwill represents approximately 35.8% of the total assets acquired ($6,892 / $19,427 * 100%)."
