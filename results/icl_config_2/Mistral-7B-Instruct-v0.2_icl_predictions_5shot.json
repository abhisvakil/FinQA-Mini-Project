We can find the total gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2008, which is $139.5 million. To find the percentage of the total ending balance that represents the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties, we first convert the given figure ($15.3 million) to a decimal by dividing it by 1,000,000 since all the figures in the table are in thousands. Then, we divide that decimal by the total gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\nSo the program should look like this:\n```python\nProgram: divide(15300, 1395490), multiply(#0, 100)\nAnswer: 0.010934\n```\nThis means that the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties represented about 1.09% of the total ending balance as of November 28, 2008."

Let's assume the redemption occurred on December 31, 2010.\n\nBefore redemption:\nThe 8.75% second priority senior secured notes had a principal amount of $ 690 million. The interest rate was 8.75%. We can calculate the annual interest cost before redemption using the formula `multiply(principal, interestRate)`.\n\nAfter redemption:\nThe company redeemed these notes at a redemption price equal to 101.458% of the principal amount redeemed ($ 714.262 million). However, they also recognized a pre-tax loss of $ 15 million on the redemption. To find the effective yield after redemption, we need to adjust the principal amount by the loss. So, the new principal amount is $ 712.762 million ($ 714.262 million - $ 15 million).\n\nNow let's calculate the annual interest cost after redemption. Since the interest rate is now based on the credit rating assigned to the loans under the credit agreement, we don't have enough information to provide an exact figure. But assuming the new interest rate is still 8.75%, we can compare the annual interest cost before and after redemption.\n\nProgram:\nsubtract(multiply(690, 0.0875), multiply(712.762, 0.0875))\nAnswer: -1.758 million\n\nThis result indicates that the company saved about $ 1.76 million annually in interest cost by redeeming the 8.75% second priority senior secured notes. Note that if the new interest rate is different than 8.75%, the savings would be different as well."

Then divide the difference by the beginning balance ($44.0) and multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage. The formula would look like this: (($44.0 - $34.3)/$44.0)*100%. However, since the given data already provides the beginning and ending balances, it can be simplified to only calculating the difference and converting it to a percentage. Therefore, the solution would be:\n\nProgram: subtract(44.0, 34.3), divide(#0, 34.3)\nAnswer: -18.18181818181818%\n\nNote: Since the result is negative, it indicates an increase rather than a decrease.

    "raw_output": "Answer: 2880 - #0\n\nThe given information does not provide enough details to directly find the operating expenses in 2006. However, the increase in operating expenses due to fuel price rise can be calculated as mentioned in the text. Using that information, the operating expenses in 2006 could be found indirectly.\n\nHere's the calculation:\n\nFirst, let's find the operating expenses in 2007:\nOperating Expenses (2007) = Cash Provided By Operating Activities (2007) + Cash Used In Investing Activities (2007) + Dividends Paid (2007)\n= $3277M + ($2426M) + ($364M)\n= $3683M\n\nNext, let's find the increase in operating expenses due to fuel price rise:\nFuel Price Increase = Fuel Surplus Revenue (2007) - Fuel Surplus Revenue (2006)\n= $242M\n\nNow, let's assume that the operating expenses excluding fuel expenses stayed constant between 2006 and 2007. We can then find the operating expenses in 2006 as follows:\n\nOperating Expenses (2006) = Operating Expenses (2007) - Fuel Price Increase\n= $3683M - $242M\n= $3441M\n\nSo, the operating expenses in 2006 were around $3.441 billion.\n\nHowever, since the exact figures for operating expenses in 2006 aren't available in the text, the solution above provides an estimate based on the given information. The actual figure might differ slightly depending on the precise distribution of expenses between fuel and non-fuel components in 2006."

The result should be expressed as a decimal or percentage.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1. First, we need to find the total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable leases and purchase obligations. This can be calculated by adding the lease obligations and purchase obligations.\n2. Next, we need to find the amount due in 2008. We know that this information is provided in the table for both lease obligations and purchase obligations.\n3. Finally, we need to determine the percentage of the total future minimum commitments that is due in 2008. To do this, we first find the total amount due in 2008 by adding the lease obligations and purchase obligations due in 2008. Then, we divide this amount by the total future minimum commitments and express the result as a decimal or percentage.\n\nSo the answer would look something like this:\nAnswer: The percentage of total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable leases and purchase obligations that is due in 2008 is X%.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any further questions or need anything else explained."

Formula rate plan increases at Entergy Louisiana ($187 million)\n2. Increase in energy efficiency rider revenue at various companies ($132 million)\n3. Annual net rate increase at Entergy Mississippi ($16 million)\n\nWe want to know the net effect of these changes on the net revenue, so we should sum them up:\n$187 + $132 + $16 = $335 million\n\nNow, let's find the impact of volume/weather:\nVolume/weather impact is listed separately as $-95 million.\n\nSo, to find the adjusted net revenue for 2015, we need to subtract the identified impacts from the reported net revenue:\nAdjusted Net Revenue = Reported Net Revenue - Retail Electric Price Impact - Volume/Weather Impact\n= $5829 - $335 - (-$95)\n= $5829 + $335 + $95\n= $6269 million\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nProgram: add(add(5829, 335), 95)\nAnswer: 6269"

    "gold_answer": "-0.55319",
    "raw_output": "subtract(#1, #10), divide(#0, #10)*100\nAnswer: 90%\n\nExplanation: In order to find the percent change in the fair value financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy during 2010 compared to 2009, we can look at the difference between the percentages of living benefit account values in the given years. The percentage of living benefit account values for 2010 and prior is 1%, while the percentage for 2011 is 0%. This means that none of the living benefit account values were included in the calculation of the fair value financial market instruments during 2011. However, in 2010, all of the living benefit account values (represented by the total row) were included, so the difference between the percentages gives us the percent change. Therefore, the program calculates the difference between the percentage for 2010 and the percentage for any other year, and then divides that difference by the percentage for 2010 to obtain the percent change. Since we want to find the percent change between 2010 and 2009, we use the percentage for 2010 and the percentage for the earliest year with observable annuitization behavior data, which is 2013. So, the program subtracts the percentage for 2013 from the percentage for 2010, divides the result by the percentage for 2010, and then multiplies the whole expression by 100 to convert the decimal result to a percentage. The answer is 90%, meaning that the fair value financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy increased by 90% during 2010 compared to 2009."

Therefore, we must first determine the number of issued and outstanding shares by finding the difference between Authorized Shares and Common Stock Subscribed.\n\nProgram: subtract(110000000, 0)\nAuthorizedShares: 110000000\nCommonStockSubscribed: 0\nIssuedAndOutstandingShares: #AuthorizedShares - #CommonStockSubscribed\nIssuedAndOutstandingShares: 110000000 - 0\nIssuedAndOutstandingShares: 110000000\n\nNow that we know the Issued and Outstanding Shares, we can find the Price Per Share by using the information about Common Stock Equity.\n\nProgram: divide(#IssuedAndOutstandingShares, 2014)\nPricePerShare: 2014\nIssuedAndOutstandingShares: 110000000\n\nFinally, we can find the Number of Shares Outstanding by multiplying the Issued and Outstanding Shares by the Price Per Share.\n\nProgram: multiply(#IssuedAndOutstandingShares, #PricePerShare)\nNumberOfSharesOutstanding: #IssuedAndOutstandingShares * #PricePerShare\nNumberOfSharesOutstanding: 110000000 * 2014\nNumberOfSharesOutstanding: 2202"

To find this percentage, first, we need to identify the total debt repayments due in 2007. This can be calculated by adding the scheduled principal payments for all debts due in 2007 (from row 'total debt' in the table). Next, we need to find the total contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations due in 2007. This can be calculated by summing the values in columns corresponding to 2007 for lease obligations and purchase obligations. Finally, we can find the percentage by dividing the total debt repayments due in 2007 by the total contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations due in 2007.\n\nThe given program calculates this percentage correctly. It uses the sum function to add the values in the 'total debt' column for the rows corresponding to 2007, and then calculates the percentage by dividing this sum by the sum of the values in the 'total debt', 'lease obligations', and 'purchase obligations' columns for the row corresponding to 2007."

It appears under 'Other Assets'. In 2006, the balance for Other Assets was $494 million. After applying SFAF No. 158, the balance became $599 million. Therefore, the increase due to SFAF No. 158 is $105 million ($599-$494). The increase in product warranties should be equal to this amount since it's the only line item changing significantly. Thus, the cash expense for product warranties in 2007 would be $524.404 million ($105 million * 1.01^2).\n\nProgram:\nmultiply(599, 1.01)^2, floor(round(#0)*1000000)/1000000 -- Rounding off to nearest million\nAnswer: 600.004\n\nHowever, upon further review, the given text mentions that product warranties are accrued at the time the associated products are sold based on historical claims experience. This implies that the balance shown in the table might already include the increase due to the percentage change in warranty claims. To confirm, we can check the footnote 13 provided in the text regarding pensions and other postretirement benefits. Unfortunately, the text doesn't provide enough detail about the product warranties specifically, so we cannot definitively say whether the balance includes the increase or not without more context.\n\nTherefore, the above solution could potentially overestimate the cash expense for product warranties in 2007. We recommend consulting the company's management or auditors for clarification on this matter."

We can subtract the size of the spaces occupied by their lease administration office and broadcast division to find the size of the space they rent out to unaffiliated tenants. The table shows that these spaces occupy approximately 57,100 square feet. Therefore, the size of the space American Tower Corporation subleases is:\n\n105,900 (total size of the Woburn property) - 57,100 (size of American Tower Corporation's spaces) = 48,800 square feet\n\nSo, the proportion of the Woburn property that is subleased is:\n\n48,800 / 105,900 = 0.4627 or 46.27%\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the portion of the property that American Tower Corporation itself subleases, not the entire property, the correct answer should be:\n\nProgram: divide(57100, 163000)\nAnswer: 0.353571428571\n\nTherefore, the portion of the Woburn property owned by American Tower Corporation that is subleased is approximately 35.36%."

The result should be reported in millions, so we simply move the decimal point over one place to the left. Therefore, the answer is $11.2 million."

We know that JPMorgan Chase authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of their common shares. Therefore, the total authorized repurchase capacity is $10.0 billion.\n\nNow, we want to find out how much of that capacity has been used. From the text provided, we learn that they didn't repurchase any shares during 2008. However, they repurchased 168 million shares for $8.2 billion at an average price per share of $48.60 during 2007. Since no shares were repurchased in 2008, the unused repurchase capacity would still be equal to the $10.0 billion authorization.\n\nSo, the percentage of authorized repurchase capacity that remained under the current stock repurchase program as of December 31, 2008, is 100%.\n\nHere's the confirmation:\n\nProgram: constant(100)\nAnswer: 100%"

    "raw_output": "subtract(#2, #1)\nAnswer: -17.0\n\nExplanation: The question asks for the change in millions of buildings from 2015 to 2016. To find this, we simply subtract the value of buildings in 2015 from the value of buildings in 2016. In the provided table, the value of buildings in 2015 is listed as $207 million, while the value of buildings in 2016 is listed as $190 million. Therefore, the change in millions of buildings from 2015 to 2016 is $-17.0 million.\n\nSo the program would look like this: `subtract(207, 190)` and the answer would be \"-$17.0\". However, since you asked for the answer in millions, we can drop the \"$\" sign and just write \"17.0\" instead of \"-17.0\", making the final answer \"17.0\". Thus, the final output should be:\n\nProgram: subtract(#2, #1)\nAnswer: 17.0"

Since the values are equal, the difference is zero. However, according to the text, the rental expense for operating leases was approximately $ 211.5 million in 2016. We can use this information to find the percentage change from 2014 to 2015. The percentage change is calculated by finding the difference between the rental expense in 2016 and 2014, dividing that difference by the rental expense in 2014, and then multiplying by 100 to convert the result to a percentage. Therefore, the program should look like this:\n\nProgram:\nsubtract(211500000, 148500000), divide(#0, 148500000), multiply(#0, 100)\nAnswer: 43.15625\n\nSo the percentage change in rental expense for operating leases from 2014 to 2015 was approximately 43.16%."

Calculate the total return of FNIS common stock between December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2016.\n2. Divide the total return by the starting value ($100).\n3.

We can directly calculate the percentage increase in FNIS common stock price over the given period without writing any code.

However, this answer doesn't make much sense because percentages cannot exceed 100%. Instead, we should interpret this figure as the total return on investment, including capital gains and dividends. To obtain the percentage return excluding dividends, we need to subtract the total dividends received during the holding period from the total return and divide the adjusted total return by the initial investment. Unfortunately, the provided table does not include detailed dividend information. Therefore, we cannot accurately compute the exact percentage cumulative 5-year total shareholder return on FNIS common stock using only the available data."

We know that the purchased technology has a weighted average useful life of 4 years. To find the annual amortization expense, we can simply take the total amortizable cost ($1,000,000) and divide it by the useful life (4 years). However, since the problem requires the answer in dollars, we also need to convert the result to an annual figure.

Therefore, the approximate total number of workforce before the restructuring program would be the total number of employees in 2010 minus the number of employees terminated. From the table, the total number of employees in 2010 was $190 million, and the number of employees terminated was 1400. So, the approximate total number of workforce before the restructuring program would be:\n\n$190 million - $1400 = $188.6 million\n\nHowever, since the answer should be given in whole numbers, let's round down to the nearest thousand:\n\n$188.6 million ≈ $188.0 million ≈ 3890 employees\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nProgram: None (since no calculations were needed)\nAnswer: Approximate total number of workforce before the restructuring program: 3890"

    "raw_output": "subtract(79, 90)\nAnswer: -11.0\n\nTo find the net income margin, we first need to calculate the net income as a percentage of sales and service revenues. Since the provided data shows a negative net income in Q4, we cannot directly use the given figures to compute the net income margin for Q1 2014. Instead, let us assume that the net income margin in Q1, Q2, and Q3 are similar to those in the corresponding quarters in the previous year (i.e., 5.91%, 6.45%, and 5.33%, respectively). We can then estimate the net income margin for Q1 2014 using these percentages and the sales and service revenues data provided.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the estimated net income for Q1 2014:\n\nEstimated Net Income = Sales and Service Revenues * Net Income Margin (Q1 2013)\n= $1,594 * 5.91%\n= $90.37 million\n\nNow, let's check if this estimation matches the given data for net income in Q1 2014 ($90):\n\nIf Estimated Net Income = Given Net Income, then Net Income Margin (Q1 2014) = Estimated Net Income / Sales and Service Revenues\n\nSince the estimates match the given data, we can conclude that the net income margin for Q1 2014 is approximately 5.91%.\n\nTherefore, the net income margin in Q1 2014 is 5.91%.\n\nHowever, since the exact figure isn't mentioned in the problem statement, we cannot provide a definitive answer without making certain assumptions. Our analysis above is based on the assumption that the net income margins in Q1, Q2, and Q3 of 2014 would remain roughly similar to those in the same quarters of 2013."

We can do this by finding the average assets under supervision for each asset class in 2016 and applying the corresponding fee rates. The fee rates aren't provided directly but since the text states that 'investors withdrew their assets', it implies that the fees were lower than usual in 2018.

Since the given information does not specify exactly which year corresponds to 2010 and which one to 2012, we cannot directly compare their values. Instead, we can calculate the ratio of the number of years for ships to the number of years for ship improvements in both cases and find the difference between those ratios. This will give us the percentage increase in the length of time for ship improvements compared to the length of time for ships being in service. The result might not represent the exact percentage increase in port costs but should provide a relative comparison between the two periods."

    "raw_output": "Answer: The information provided does not directly state the fixed price contract backlog at December 31, 2011. However, if we assume that the increase in net sales between 2010 and 2011 ($1030.9 million) is mostly attributed to fixed price contracts, we could estimate the figure as follows:\n\nProgram: multiply(1030.9, 0.9) -- assuming 90% of the increase in net sales comes from fixed price contracts\nAnswer: 927.81\n\nSo the estimated fixed price contract backlog at December 31, 2011 would be around $927.81 million. Please keep in mind that this is an estimation based on the given information and might not be entirely accurate."

Then, subtract the amortization expense in 2006 from the average increase to find the average amortization expense.\n\nThe increase in amortization expense between 2006 and 2008 is ($77M + $64M) = $141M.\n\nSo, the average amortization expense from 2006 to 2008 would be:\n\n$141M / 2 = $70.5M\n\nBut the provided solution calculates the average as $115.33M, which is incorrect.

To find this, first we need to find the difference between the net derivative liabilities and collateral posted for that year. Then, we compare this difference with the additional collateral or termination payments for a one-notch downgrade. Since the given number ($1303) is smaller than the difference found earlier ($11773), the answer must be the difference between net derivative liabilities and collateral posted for 2011. Therefore, the answer is $11773."
