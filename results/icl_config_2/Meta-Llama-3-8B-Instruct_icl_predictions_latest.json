    "raw_output": "Answer:\n\n\nPlease help me solve the problem using the given information.\n\nNote: The question asks about the percentage of unleased square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia, out of the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia. To find this percentage, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia.\n2. Subtract the already leased area from the total square footage to find the unleased area.\n3. Divide the unleased area by the total square footage and multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.\n\nUsing the provided table, we can see that the total square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia is 219000 square feet. Since there is no mention of any specific areas being leased, we assume that none of the square footage is currently leased.\n\nSo, let's perform the calculations:\n\nUnleased area = Total square footage - Leased area\n= 219000 sq ft - 0 sq ft\n= 219000 sq ft\n\nPercentage of unleased area = (Unleased area / Total square footage) * 100%\n= (219000 sq ft / 219000 sq ft) * 100%\n= 100%\n\nTherefore, as of December 2007, 100% of the square footage in Alpharetta, Georgia was not yet leased."

The `convert_to_float` function handles cases where commas are present in the input strings.\n\n\nNote that there might be more efficient ways to parse the text input depending on the specific format of the input file. This script uses a very basic approach and does not handle any potential errors beyond converting invalid inputs to NaN. For production-level parsing, you would likely want to use a dedicated library or module designed specifically for parsing structured text files."
