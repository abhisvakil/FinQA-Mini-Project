However, the provided information shows the rental expense and future minimum lease commitments for both continuing and discontinued operations combined. To find the decrease in rental expense for operating leases in continuing operations specifically, we need to first calculate the rental expense for discontinued operations for each year and subtract it from the total rental expense. Then, we can find the decrease in rental expense for continuing operations by subtracting the rental expense for the previous year. In the given table, the rental expense and future minimum lease commitments are listed under the total column, so we need to extract the amounts for continuing operations only. Unfortunately, the table does not provide this information directly. However, we can infer that the"

Therefore, the net change would be the difference between these two amounts, which is calculated as subtracting the smaller amount ($86) from the larger amount ($119).

It then subtracts the preferred dividends paid (non-cumulative preferred stock + cumulative preferred stock) and adds back any new common equity issued. Finally, it divides the result by 10 to get the minimum capital requirement in billions. The minimum capital requirement according to the Net Capital Rule is $5 billion, so the calculation above finds the minimum capital requirement in excess of that amount."

To find this, we first need to calculate the total interest and penalties for the year. We can do this by adding the additions for tax positions of the current year, additions for tax positions of prior years, and settlements with tax authorities for 2015. This gives us $11. However, we also need to subtract the reductions for tax positions of prior years and expiration of the statute of limitations, which results in a net increase of $9. We then add the interest income of $2 to get the total interest and penalties for the year, which is $11+$2=$13.\n\nTo find the difference between the interest and penalties and the interest income, we simply subtract the interest income from the total interest and penalties.

We can do this by defining two functions: `call_centers` and `size`. The `call_centers` function will return a list containing the number of call centers in each row of the table, while the `size` function will extract the size of the call centers from the table.\n\nOnce we have defined these functions, we can use the `map` function to apply the `size` function to each element in the `call_centers` list, and then use the `sum` function to add up all the sizes. Finally, we can divide the sum of the sizes by the length of the `call_centers` list to get"

Instead, it states that net interest income in 2018 was 28% higher than in 2017, and it provides the exact values for both years. Using this information, we can calculate the net interest income value for 2016 by finding 28% of the net interest income value for 2017 and adding it to the net interest income value for 2017.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net interest income value for 2017:\n```vbnet\nprogram: multiply(3770, 0.01)\nanswer: 38.61\n```\nNext, let's calculate the net interest income value for "

In the provided context, income taxes paid can be found in the 'income taxes' row under 'other accrued liabilities' for the year 2013, which is $7.7 million. Income tax expense can be calculated by finding the total other accrued liabilities for 2013 ($243.7 million) and subtracting the sum of all other line items in the table for 2013 ($229.1 million). This leaves us with $11.6 million for income tax expense. However, since the question asks for the difference between income taxes paid and income tax expense, we need to take the absolute value of the difference, resulting in an answer of $11.9 million."

To answer this question, we need to compare the cumulative total shareholder return of Altria to that of its peer group and the S&P 500 over the same period. We are given a table showing the closing prices of Altria, its peer group, and the S&P 500 on certain dates.\n\nTo calculate the cumulative total shareholder return, we can use the formula: Cumulative Total Shareholder Return = Final Price / Initial Price. We are given the final prices for Altria, its peer group, and the S&P 500, so we can calculate the initial prices by dividing the final prices by the corresponding values in the table.\n\nWe want to know if Altria outperformed its peer group, so we need to compare the cumulative total shareholder return of Altria to that of its peer group.

We know that 1400 + 530 = 1930 employees were terminated by the end of 2011, and we can assume that the majority of these terminations occurred before the end of 2011 since the text states that \"in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011.\" Therefore, we can estimate that the approximate total number of employees before the restructuring program was around 383"

To find the percentage decline in the operating loss, we need to first calculate the absolute difference between the operating losses in the two years, and then divide that difference by the operating loss in the earlier year and multiply by 100 to get the percentage decline. Therefore, the program should be:\n```vbnet\nsubtract(1201, 2199) # Find the difference between the operating losses\ndivide(#0, 100) # Divide the difference by the earlier operating loss and multiply by 100 to get the percentage decline\n```\nHowever, since the text states that the percentage decline is not meaningful, the final answer should just be an empty string or `\"\"`. But since the guidelines require us to generate a complete program and output a final answer, we can output the percentage decline calculated above as"
