However, the provided information does not directly give the values for the unrecognized tax benefits at those dates. Instead, it gives the balances of the net deferred tax liability, which includes both deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the accrued interest associated with tax positions.\n\nTo find the change in unrecognized tax benefits, we need to calculate the difference between the beginning and ending balances of the net deferred tax assets (which represent unrecognized tax benefits). However, the table does not provide the separate amounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the change in unrecognized tax benefits from the given information.\n\nInstead, we can see that the net deferred tax liability decreased by $ 35 million from the end of 2014 to the end of 2015. Since net deferred tax liability represents the sum of deferred tax assets"

It does this by finding the difference between the annual interest cost of the remaining recourse debt and the annual interest cost if the redeemed notes were still part of the debt. The annual interest cost of the remaining recourse debt is calculated by dividing the total recourse debt by 12 to find the annual maturities, and then taking the last element in the list which represents the annual maturities after the redeemed notes. The annual interest cost if the redeemed notes were still part of the debt is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of the redeemed notes by the interest rate and dividing by 100 to get the decimal form of the interest rate, and then multiplying by 12 to find the annual interest cost. Finally, the difference between these two values is found by subtracting the latter from the former.\n\nThe final"

To find this, we need to subtract the December 31, 2013 value from the December 31, 2014 value and then convert the result to millions. However, the table shows a decrease in tax credit investments from $2,572 million to $2,616 million. This is incorrect, as the text states that the unfunded commitments have increased from $802 million to $717 million. Therefore, we need to subtract the correct difference in unfunded commitments instead. We do this by finding the negative of the difference between the December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 values for unfunded commitments, and then adding this to the difference in the total equity investment balances.\n\nTherefore"

Therefore, the net change in tax positions is $195,237 - $177,947 = $17,290.

According to the context, the maximum performance pool of $22825000 was established in April 2007, but no information is given about how much was actually contributed to the pool during the relevant years. However, we can find the balance at the beginning and end of each year, as well as the grants and cancellations during those years. By subtracting the beginning balance from the end balance and adding back any grants and subtracting any cancellations, we can find the net contribution to the pool during each year. We need to find the net contribution during the years 2006 and 2007, so we can subtract the beginning balance of 2007 from the end balance of 2007, and then subtract the beginning balance"

We know that the total assets under supervision (AUS) in 2016 were $1309 billion. To find the net income, we can use the following formula:\n\nNet Income = Total Revenues - Total Expenses\n\nWe don't have the exact revenue and expense figures for 2016, but we do have them for 2017 and 2018. We also know that the mix of assets between long-term AUS and liquidity products changed slightly between 2016 and 2017. Therefore, we can make an assumption that the revenue and expense ratios for long-term AUS and liquidity products remained roughly constant between 2016 and 2017.\n\nLet's assume that the revenue ratio for long-term AUS is 70%, and the revenue"

To find this, we first need to determine the increase in accrued pensions between 2006 and 2007, which is given as -258 million. We then need to calculate the percentage increase in accrued pensions between these years, which is 1.06. Finally, we can find the cash expense for product warranties in 2007 by multiplying the accrued pensions amount before the application of SFA no. 158 (-371 million) by this percentage increase. Rounding the result to 2 decimal places gives us the final answer of 405.58 million."

We can calculate the total revenue for 2012 by finding the product of sales and operating working capital as a percentage of sales:\n\nTotal revenue = Sales * Operating working capital as % of sales\n\nWe know that total capital spending was $533 million in 2012, so we can find the total sales by dividing total capital spending by the capital spending as a percentage of sales:\n\nTotal sales = Total capital spending / Capital spending as % of sales\n\nNow we can find the sales by solving for sales in the equation for total revenue:\n\nSales = Total revenue / Operating working capital as % of sales\n\nSubstituting the values we have calculated, we get:\n\nSales = $533 million / 19.7%\nSales ="

To find this, we need to look at the balance at December 31, 2008 ($ 99 million) and subtract the amount of settlements (-$ 21 million). Then, we need to add back the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that were recognized in 2008 ($ 88 million). Therefore, the program subtracts $ 21 million from $ 99 million and adds back $ 88 million to get the final answer of $ 87.0 million."

We can find this information in the table provided. The accrued balance related to severance and related charges is $0.3 million and the accrued balance related to lease termination costs is $0.1 million. To get the total balance in millions, we need to add these two amounts together and convert them to millions. Therefore, the program consists of adding the subtraction of the accrued balance at November 27, 1998, related to severance and related charges from the accrued balance at December 3, 1999, related to severance and related charges, and the subtraction of the accrued balance at November 27, 1998, related to lease termination costs from the accrued balance at December"

To find this, we need to calculate the difference between the amounts recognized in interest and penalties in 2015 and the sum of those amounts in the previous years. We can do this by subtracting the total amount recognized in 2015 (8+2=10) from the sum of the amounts recognized in the previous years (1+2=3). Then, we need to subtract this difference from the effective tax rate for 2015 (12%) to get the final answer. However, since the question asks for the size of the interest and penalties compared to the interest income, we need to make sure to include the interest income amounts in our calculation as well. We can find the interest income amounts from the table provided. Therefore, the complete program is:\n\nsubtract(8, 2)"

We can see from the table that the net asbestos reserves for assumed reinsurance is currently $32 million. In the context provided, we know that there were unfavorable developments on assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. Therefore, we need to find the difference between the current net asbestos reserves for assumed reinsurance and the net asbestos reserves it would have been if those unfavorable developments hadn't occurred.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the net asbestos reserves for assumed reinsurance before the unfavorable developments. We know that the total gross reserves for assumed reinsurance is $39 million, and the total ceded reserves is $47 million. Using the given survival ratios of "

Next, calculate the percentage change in the total impact between those two years: subtract the total impact in 2011 from that in 2012, divide the result by the total impact in 2011, and finally subtract the result from 1 to get the percentage decrease.

To find this difference, we need to subtract the income tax expense from the income taxes paid. According to the provided table, the income taxes paid were $7.7 billion and the income tax expense was $14.6 billion. Therefore, the difference is calculated as follows:\n\nsubtract(7.7, 14.6) = -6.9 billion\ndivide(-6.9, 1000000000) = -0.03125\n\nSo the answer is -$0.03125 billion or -$31.25 million. However, since the question asks for the answer in millions, we can simply drop the decimal point and round up to get the final answer of -$31.25 million.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n"

However, the table provided does not give the exact figures for capital expenditures in those years. Instead, it gives the anticipated capital expenditures for the next few years. To find the percentage change, we would need to know the actual figures for 2017 and 2018. Since the information is not given, we cannot provide a valid answer. Therefore, the answer is an error message indicating that the required information is missing.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the capital expenditures are roughly equal to the ship construction contracts, we can make an estimate based on the given information. In this case, the capital expenditures for 2018 would be around $1.59 billion (the total for ship construction contracts in 2018). And the capital expenditures for 2017 would be around $1."

However, the text does not provide explicit information about the number of towers that were actually purchased. Instead, it mentions that the company purchased up to 1500 towers from Vivo S.A., but no specific number is given.\n\nTo find an answer, we need to make some assumptions or calculations based on the given information. One possible approach is to assume that the company actually purchased the maximum number of towers (i.e., 1500 towers) based on the purchase agreement, and then calculate the cost per tower from the purchase price allocation.\n\nAccording to the table, the property and equipment in the final purchase price allocation is $83,539 thousand. Since we assume that this amount corresponds to the cost of the 1500 towers, we can calculate the cost per tower by dividing the total cost by the number of towers. Therefore, the answer is $83,53"

However, it does not specify the useful life of land improvements. Therefore, we cannot directly calculate the annual depreciation rate for land improvements from the given information. Instead, we can infer that the total property and equipment consists of 20% land improvements, 39-40% buildings, and 3-10% furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Based on this information, we can calculate the percentage of total property and equipment represented by land improvements and use that to find the annual depreciation rate. We do this by dividing the percentage of total property and equipment represented by land improvements by 100 to get a decimal value, and then dividing that decimal value by the number of years in the estimated useful life of the property and equipment (which is not given in the text). This gives us an estimate of the annual depreciation rate for land improvements based on the given information.\n\nThere"

However, the question asks specifically for the amount of fixed price contracts in the contracted backlog at December 31, 2011, in millions of dollars. To find this value, we need to consult the text provided for more information.\n\nThe text states that the company recognizes sales under long-term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the percentage of completion under the cost-to-cost method of accounting. This means that the revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized over the duration of the contract as work progresses. Therefore, the contracted backlog at December 31, 2011, for fixed price contracts would be equivalent to the net sales recognized under the percentage of completion method for the aerospace and technologies segment in 2011.\n\nTo find this"
