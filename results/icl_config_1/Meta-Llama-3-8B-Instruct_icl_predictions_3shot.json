The growth rate is calculated as ((end value - start value) / start value) * 100%. In this case, the end value is the balance of standby letters of credit in 2007 ($4711 million), and the start value is the balance of standby letters of credit in 2006 ($4926 million). The program should first calculate the difference between the end and start values, then divide the result by the start value, and finally multiply the result by 100%. The output should be the growth rate as a decimal value. For example, if the growth rate is 1.14%, the output would be 0.0114."

However, we can infer that operating expenses are the difference between net sales and operating profit. Therefore, we need to calculate the total operating expenses for 2016.\n\nFirst, let's find the total operating expenses for 2015:\n\nOperating Profit (2015) = $1282\nNet Sales (2015) = $6770\n\nTotal Operating Expenses (2015) = Net Sales (2015) - Operating Profit (2015) = $6770 - $1282 = $5488\n\nNow, let's find the total operating expenses for 2016:\n\nOperating Profit (2016) = $1018\nNet Sales (2016) = $6608\n\nTotal Operating Expenses (2016) = Net Sales (2016) - Operating Profit (2016) = $6608 - $1018 = $5590\n\nSo, the total operating expenses for 2016 are $5590.\n\nProgram: subtract(6608, 1018)\nAnswer: 5590\n\nFinal Answer: 5590\n\nI hope this helps!
