To do this, you'll need to subtract the 2017 expense from the 2018 expense, then divide the result by the 2017 expense, and finally multiply by 100. \n\nExample: \nLet's say the pre-tax pension and postretirement expense in 2017 is $199 million and in 2018 is $164 million. To find the percentage change, you'd follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract the 2017 expense from the 2018 expense: $164 million - $199 million = -$35 million\n2. Divide the result by the 2017 expense: -$35 million / $199 million = -0.175\n3. Multiply by 100: (-0.175) * 100 = -17.5%\n\nSo, the pre-tax pension and postretirement expense decreased by 17.5% from 2017 to 2018. \n\nRemember to format your output according to the guidelines provided earlier.

Calculate the difference between the two values: `subtract(127.1, 148.9)`\n2. Divide the result by the original value: `divide(#0, 148.9)`\n3. Multiply the result by 100: `multiply(#0, 100)`\n\nThis will give you the percentage decrease from 2017 to 2018. To get the percentage increase, simply negate the result: `negate(multiply(#0, 100))` \n\nRemember to include the program code in your output, followed by the final answer.

However, I can try to extract the relevant information from the tables provided.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the company contributed $264 million to its U.S. and international pension plans in 2015, and $210 million in 2014. To find the ratio of the company contribution to the US qualified and non-qualified pension benefits for 2015 compared to 2014, we can use the following formula:\n\nRatio = (Company Contribution 2015 / Company Contribution 2014)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nRatio = ($264 million / $210 million) = 1.257143\n\nSo, the ratio of the company contribution to the US qualified and non-qualified pension benefits for 2015 compared to 2014 is approximately 1.257143 or 125.71%. This means that the company contributed 25.71% more to its US qualified and non-qualified pension benefits in 2015 compared to "

    "gold_answer": "13.4",
    "raw_output": "Please provide the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year.\n\nNote: You need to calculate the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year. To do this, first, find the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock as of May 31, 2013 ($33.5 million). Then, find the weighted average period over which this cost is expected to be recognized (2.5 years).\n\nNext, use these values to calculate the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year. You can do this by dividing the total unrecognized compensation cost by the weighted average period and then multiplying the result by 4 (since there are 4 years in the given period).\n\nThe calculation would look like this:\n\nAverage unrecognized compensation cost per year = Total unrecognized compensation cost / Weighted average period * 4\n= $33,500,000 / 2.5 years * 4\n= $53,600,000 per year\n\nSo, the average unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock per year is $53,600,000. \n\nFinal Answer: Program: multiply(divide(33500000, 2.5), 4) ### Final Answer:"

For example, you can use the `subtract` operation to calculate the decline in uncertain tax positions. You need to analyze the table and identify the relevant values to perform the calculation. Then, you can use the operations to generate the program. After the program is complete, you must compute and state the final result. Remember to follow the guidelines provided earlier."
